                      Pratap Singh I, popularly known as <b>Maharana Pratap</b> 
                      <i>(9 May 1540 - 19 January 1597)</i>, was a king of Mewar 
                      from the Sisodia dynasty. Pratap became a folk hero for 
                      his military resistance against the expansionism of the 
                      Mughal Empire under Akbar through guerrilla warfare which 
                      proved inspirational for later rebels against Mughals including 
                      Shivaji.
                      Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai.
                      His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. 
                      Pratap also had 2 stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. He was 
                      married to Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia and he had married 10 other 
                      women and was survived by 17 sons and 5 daughters including Amar Singh I.
                      He belonged to the Royal Family of Mewar.After the death of Udai Singh in 
                      1572, Rani Dheer Bai wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior 
                      courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The 
                      desire of the nobles prevailed. Udai Singh died in 1572, and Prince Pratap 
                      ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line 
                      of the Sisodia Rajputs. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to 
                      join the armies of Akbar, and obtained the town of Jahazpur as a Jagir as 
                      a gift in return for his help.
                      Reportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained 
                      in a hunting accident, at Chavand on 19 January 1597, 
                      aged 56.He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I. 
                      On his death bed, Pratap told his son never to submit to the 
                      Mughals and to win Chittor back.</p>
